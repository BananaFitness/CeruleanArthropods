## Introduction
The Roadmap lays out our plan for where we see this project (Eir) can go.  It includes features that we have planned but not have yet implemented.  It is updated as this changes or as we complete or plan more features.

## Vision
We started this as a one-week project to gain more coding experience by rebuilding an existing platform out there called [Watsi](https://watsi.org/) or however much we could accomplish in our given timeframe.  However, Eir does not have to be limited to what Watsi is capable of and does not have to just emulate it.  Ultimately, its purpose is to connect people who have limited financial access to medical treatments that could save their life or dramatically increase their quality of life with potential donors looking to help out, and also simplify that process as much as possible.  It could go anywhere from here.

## Potential Future Features
Currently, our app is only capable of adding patients and submitting donations, which updates the patient's progress to their goal.

### Financial Payments
Eir lacks the ability to accept actual payments for donations.

### User/Donor Profile
It would be useful to be able to display what donors have donated to a specific patient and for a donor to view what patients they have donated to.

### Testing scripts
Unit testing scripts have only been partially completed at this point.
